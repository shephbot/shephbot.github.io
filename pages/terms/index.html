<h2>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities ("Statement," "Terms," or "SRR") is our terms of service that governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Shephbot, as well as Shephbot brands, products and services, which we call the “Shephbot Services” or “Services”. By using or accessing the Shephbot Services, you agree to this Statement, as updated from time to time. Additionally, you will find resources at the end of this document that help you understand how Shephbot works.
Because Shephbot provides a wide range of Services, we may ask you to review and accept supplemental terms that apply to your interaction with a specific app, product, or service. To the extent those supplemental terms conflict with this SRR, the supplemental terms associated with the app, product, or service govern with respect to your use of such app, product or service to the extent of the conflict.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="privacy">
<h2>Privacy</h2>
<p>Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Policy to make important disclosures about how you can use Shephbot to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Policy, and to use it to help you make informed decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sharing-your-content-and-information">
<h2>Sharing Your Content and Information</h2>
<p>You own all of the content and information you post on Shephbot, and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings. In addition:</p>
<p>For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Shephbot (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.</p>
<p>When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</p>
<p>When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information as well as content and information that others have shared with you.  We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.  (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control what information other people may share with applications, read our Data Policy and Platform Page.)</p>
<p>When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Shephbot, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).</p>
<p>We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Shephbot, but you understand that we may use your feedback or suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="safety">
<h2>Safety</h2>

</ul>

<li>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account or Page, we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe it is appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user's actual name).</li>
</ul>

<li>If we remove your content for infringing someone else's copyright, and you believe we removed it by mistake, we will provide you with an opportunity to appeal.</li>
<li>If you repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate.</li>
<li>You will not use our copyrights or Trademarks or any confusingly similar marks, except as expressly permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written permission.</li>
<li>If you collect information from users, you will: obtain their consent, make it clear you (and not Shephbot) are the one collecting their information, and post a privacy policy explaining what information you collect and how you will use it.</li>
<li>You will not post anyone's identification documents or sensitive financial information on Shephbot.</li>
<li>You will not tag users or send email invitations to non-users without their consent. Shephbot offers social reporting tools to enable users to provide feedback about tagging.</li>
